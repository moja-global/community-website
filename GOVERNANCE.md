# Governance

Community Website is managed under an open governance model as described in the [moja global charter](https://github.com/moja-global/About_moja_global/blob/master/Governance/moja-global-charter.pdf). Community website is led by a set of maintainers, who can be found in the `MAINTAINERS.md` file.

## Maintainers

Community website is led by the project’s maintainers. The maintainers are responsible for reviewing and merging all patches submitted for review, and they guide the overall technical direction of the project within the guidelines established by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

## Becoming a Maintainer

The maintainers will consider adding or removing a maintainer occasionally. To apply for being a maintainer, you must be an existing contributor and should submit a change to the `MAINTAINERS.md` file. The contributor may become a maintainer by a three-quarters approval of the proposal by the existing maintainers. Once approved, the contributor would be onboarded as a maintainer. To remove a concerned maintainer, the same steps would be followed and a concerned change should be submitted as a PR.

Due to prolonged inactivity (3 or more months), maintainers would be removed. A maintainer removed for inactivity would be restored once they have resumed contributions, after which they can submit a change to the `MAINTAINERS.md` file. If a maintainer is unavailable, we would request them to acknowledge the same and let us know their availability and further plans.

## Feature/Enhancement proposals

Changes that are either bug fixes, direct and small improvements can be submitted as a Pull Request. The maintainers will review the changes and merge them into the main branch. For more substantial changes, a feature/enhancement proposal is required. These proceed through the approval process like typical PRs or a series of PRs, and require maintainer's approval.

In particular, all contributors to the project should have enough time to voice an opinion on feature/enhancement proposals before they are accepted. The maintainers will determine some “comment period” between proposal submission and acceptance so that contributors have enough time to voice their opinions.

## Approving Pull Requests

Maintainers are required to review PRs at regular intervals. Every request must be reviewed by at least two maintainers. A PR submitted by a maintainer, must be reviewed as well with the two reviewers different from the PR author.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

We are committed to processing pull requests from everyone in a fair manner meaning that pull requests are to be reviewed in order of submission. We understand that few PRs undergo a lengthy feedback loop which takes time. We are committed to prioritizing the review of PRs in order of submission.

## Merging Pull Requests

All the Pull Requests, having two or more approvals, from the maintainers or the community members would be merged automatically. The maintainers would be notified of the merge. To merge a Pull Request, use the `Squash and Merge` option if the PR corresponds to one logical change. If the PR is a series of changes, use the `Rebase and Merge` option. Avoid creating a `Merge Commit` while merging the Pull Request.

## Maintainer Meeting

The maintainers hold regular maintainers meetings, which are open to everyone. The purpose of the maintainers meeting is to plan for and review the progress of releases,
and to discuss the technical and operational direction of the project.

## Future changes

The governance of Community website may change as the project evolves. In particular, if the project becomes large, we will incorporate tiered maintainership, with top-level maintainers, subprojects, subproject maintainers, release managers, and so forth.  We emphasize that this document is intended to be “living” and will be updated periodically.
