Moja global is excited to announce the selection of [two Outreachy interns](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2022-05/#:~:text=workflows%20using%20MDF-,moja%20global,-Kateryna%20Derhaus) working to support our mission in developing open-source Monitoring, Reporting and Verifying (MRV) software for forestry, agriculture and other land use (AFOLU) sectors. 

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) provides open-source internships to underrepresented groups in the technology industry. Through Outreachy, we can provide a platform for our interns to learn about our open-source software and gain experience in the industry while making viable contributions to the open-source community.

## Project

Moja global participated in the May 2022 Outreachy internships with the project **Research data sources for carbon sequestration in forests**. The project aims to develop a pilot project to monitor the effect of forest management practices around the world while supporting forest owners, stakeholders, and policymakers. The interns will use various forest management indicators and a representative sample of the ecosystem and climatic conditions to develop an open-source workflow for assessing ecological conditions in forests around the world.

They will also be developing a semi-automated, FLINT-based workflow to run a unique FLINT simulation of forest dynamics for each location. The interns will also be responsible for publishing their findings openly on our repositories, with editorial support from the moja global Technical Steering Committee.

Based on the work developed and the other contributions, we selected two interns: [Kateryna Derhaus](https://github.com/derha) and [Ankita Sharma](https://github.com/ankitaS11).

## Outreachy Intern #1: Kateryna Derhaus

</p>

Kateryna is a Computer Engineering major at Ankara University, Turkey. Her interest lies in data analytics, and she enjoys exploring new technologies and automating some of her daily routines. Her desire to contribute and impact the world she lives in led her to apply to Outreachy. She found the moja global project a perfect match for her interests, and by the end of the contribution period, she was sure about her decision. Her mission is to make a positive change, work on a great variety of existing projects and be a part of the welcoming community at moja global.

## Outreachy Intern #2: Ankita Sharma

</p>

Ankita is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication from the International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur, India. She found an early-career interest in Computer Science and always wanted to see how real-life development works in an organization which led her to open-source development. She learned about Outreachy while I searched for open source opportunities and discovered the moja global organization and found the project very interesting. After contributing during the contribution period, she is excited to work for the common goal with the moja global community!

We want to thank the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) for running the Outreachy internships. Welcome, Kateryna and Ankita to the Outreachy Internships! Thanks for your interest, and we hope it will be a great learning experience for all of you!
