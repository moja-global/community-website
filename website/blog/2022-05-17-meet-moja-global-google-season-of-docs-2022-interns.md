Moja global is excited to announce the selection of two Google Season of Docs interns working to support our mission in developing open-source Monitoring, Reporting, and Verifying (MRV) software for forestry, agriculture, and other land use (AFOLU) sectors.

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs)  is an annual program by Google providing an opportunity for technical writers to contribute to open-source software. Moja global has been participating in Google Season of Docs (GSoD) for the past two years, and we are participating for the third time this year. This year's Google Season of Docs aims to build technical documentation, case studies, and testing existing documentation alongside preparing an all-new FLINT handbook and preparing credible docs on climate science.

## About the project

Last year’s Google Season of Docs saw the development of a Documentation Working Group, led by our Google Season of Docs interns, which has led to a 400% increase in the community size due to the active engagement, thus providing an easy entry point for new contributions. Though we saw a rise in technical documentation, reference guides, and case studies, there is still much to do. We are currently focussing on more technical documentation regarding the capabilities of our central framework to provide clear examples of common FLINT use cases.

While the FLINT framework can describe any generic stock and flow model (including finances, water, or biodiversity), landscape and carbon process modeling is the most popular use case. In addition to technical documentation of our software, we will also be building the FLINT Analysis Handbook, which will serve as a gentle introduction for new users progressing through the FLINT training examples. These projects will explain the core ecosystem and analysis concepts taking place when running a FLINT model and how it exactly works!

Based on the application process, which revolved around submitting a proposal (covering their technical writing & open-source experience) and community interactions, we selected two mentees:  [Namya LG](https://www.linkedin.com/in/namyalg/)  and  [Amarachi Iheanacho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amarachi-iheanacho-0126861a6/).

## Namya LG

</p>

Namya LG is an open-source enthusiast and loves learning and experimenting. She is very passionate about documenting her developer journey and writes on [Medium](https://namyalg.medium.com/). Namya started contributing to moja global through the Winter Of Code program in 2021. She is inspired by moja global’s initiative to combat the climate crisis using technology and has contributed to the community website, FLINT Cloud, FLINT Reporting, and is currently exploring more in the moja global ecosystem.

Namya will be working on the [Building technical documentation, case studies, and testing existing documentation](https://github.com/moja-global/mentorship/blob/main/google-season-of-docs/GSOD-2022-Project.md#building-technical-documentation-case-studies-and-testing-existing-documentation) project, where she will work on developing technical documentation for moja global users, building credible case studies to promote moja global’s FLINT further, and building a pipeline to test and validate existing documentation.

## Amarachi Iheanacho

</p>

Amarachi Iheanacho is a software engineer and an adept technical writer. With over 2 years of experience in creating technical articles and end-user documentation, Amarachi has created technical content for organizations like Cloudinary, Appwrite, Devwares, and Hackernoon.

Amarachi will be working on the [Building FLINT handbook and preparing credible docs on climate science](https://github.com/moja-global/mentorship/blob/main/google-season-of-docs/GSOD-2022-Project.md#building-flint-handbook-and-preparing-credible-docs-on-climate-science) project, where she will write more approachable FLINT development and calibration documentation. It will help our users and contributors better understand climate science, carbon models, and how FLINT fits amongst them.

## How to get involved?​​

Moja global hosts mentorship programs all year round. You can find more details about the projects at moja global on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/moja-global) and the various mentorship programs we participate in on our [initiatives page](https://community.moja.global/initiatives). These mentorship programs allow students and professionals to learn more about open-source software and get involved in the open-source community.

If you are interested in learning more about open-source software, or if you are interested in getting involved in the open-source community, please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/mojaglobal/shared_invite/zt-o6ta1ug0-rVLjAo460~d7JbZ~HpFFtw).
