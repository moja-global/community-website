## 1. Introduction to GCBM
### I. FLINT Software Explained
The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is the flagship software developed by the Moja.Global community. It is an integrating platform for estimating land-based greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Integrating refers to FLINT’s design to combine a wide range of data with models to achieve more accurate estimates of stocks and fluxes of greenhouse gases. FLINT is consistent with the UNFCCC guidelines.

### II. Modular Structure of FLINT
The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is the flagship software developed by the Moja.Global community. The GCBM is one set of science modules running on the FLINT platform. It reproduces the science of the CBM-CFS3 carbon budget model to produce tier 3 estimates of the greenhouse gas balance of the forest sector. It is an integrating platform for estimating land-based greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Integrating refers to FLINT’s design to combine a wide range of data with models to achieve more accurate estimates of stocks and fluxes of greenhouse gases.

## 4. Adapting the GCBM Template

### I. Introduction
In this video series, we’re going to run through an exercise that will involve taking an example GCBM dataset and simulation workflow, and reconfiguring and simulating it with a new sample data set. This will demonstrate the standard process users will employ whenever they want to run a GCBM simulation with their own data.

This introduction video explores the sample data in the template.
