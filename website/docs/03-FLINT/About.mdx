## Purpose and Overview

The FLINT is a fully modular system that allows users to integrate carbon and other models with remote sensing data to produce greenhouse gas accounts for the land sector.

The overall framework will be based on the simulation of events and processes. Modules with variable time steps can therefore be accommodated. Key elements of the framework will include the overall integration module, a transaction service, and individual modules that are easily exchanged and modified, and that each serve key functions such as representation of growth, decomposition, disturbances, forest management actions and so on. Other key elements such as the management of the events stream, the data platform and results processing capabilities will be described elsewhere.

## Project Goals

- Provide a flexible and modular approach that allows specific countries from [IPCC Tier 1 to 3](https://www.reddcompass.org/mgd-content-v1/dita-webhelp/en/Box1.html) to implement a [comprehensive, sample-based, jurisdictional and supply chain-based approach.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5896200f414fb57d26f3d600/t/59362b028419c2db8f57e747/1496722191543/REDD_nested_projects.pdf)
- Features the ability to cover all [land uses and land use changes, and activity-based reporting such as REDD+.](https://theredddesk.org/what-redd).
- Integrates scenario analysis systems to allow the development of projections.
- Showcase the potential for a variety of other purposes, including economics, water, and biodiversity.
- Offer a software that allows data processing on local desktops or cloud-based systems.

## Project Features

- FLINT combines remote sensing, models and ground data and produces outputs in a wide range of formats, including maps, tables and reports.
- FLINT ensures the system maintains mass-balance, i.e. matter (e.g. carbon) cannot disappear or be created, there is always a source pool and a destination pool.
- FLINT's design combine a wide range of data with models to achieve more accurate estimates of stocks and fluxes of greenhouse gases.
- FLINT utilizes scientific modules & models to estimate fluxes of GHGs between pools and uses the the same models for making projections as for monitoring implementation progress.
- FLINT has been used across various programs and the users include Kenya, Indonesia and Canada along with pilot programs and trainins being run in more countries.
