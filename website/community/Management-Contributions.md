## Coach new contributors

moja global is increasingly looking for new contributors who can contribute to our projects and processes. To help them better involve with the community and ensure that their potential is utilized appropriately, we request our community members to coach or train new contributors. If you have experience and want to help, please send an email to [mentorship@moja.global](mailto:mentorship@moja.global).

**Coaches** are experienced engineers or scientists or users who are available to work shoulder to shoulder with new developers, users, or contributors.

**Ambassadors** are experienced engineers or scientists or users who are available to provide training to groups of new developers, users, or contributors.

As a Coach or an Ambassador, you need to ensure that the new contributors get the required mentorship to help them succeed in the community and drive a positive impact.

1. Ensure that the Contributors know that you are a Coach.

    - Ensure that you have a track record that proves you know the repository, the processes, the purpose and the contents well.
    - Ensure you have already [claimed credit](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Get-Credit-for-Your-Contribution.md) for your work in the past.
    - Add your name to Coaches in the `README` file by copying your avatar and name from the _all-contributors_ section and pasting it under the _Coaches_ header.
    - Submit a Pull-Request with your proposed changes. It would be reviewed and merged.

2. Ensure that the Contributors know that you are an Ambassador.
    - Ensure that you have a track record that proves you know the repository, the processes, the purpose and contents well.
    - Ensure that you have gained credit as a Coach and that you have experience in delivering training to new contributors.
    - Ensure you have already [claimed credit](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Get-Credit-for-Your-Contribution.md) for your work in the past.
    - Add your name to Ambassadors in the `README` document by copying your avatar and name from the _all-contributors_ section and pasting it under the _Ambassadors_ header.
    - Submit a Pull-Request with your proposed changes. It would be reviewed and merged.

## Manage backlog system

The moja global Backlog system is designed to be a simple system to manage the backlog of bugs and features. Two GitHub tools are used to manage the backlog, **Issues** and **Projects**.

Issues are used for managing bugs associated with existing code or for requesting feature enhancements within existing repositories. To create a new bug to add to the backlog check [how to report bugs](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Report-Bugs.md) and for creating a new feature request check [how to create a new feature](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Request-a-New-Feature.md).

Projects are used where the proposed feature (or a new functionality) is best implemented as a new repository. An example might be a new FLINT module. For tips on setting up a new project check out how you can create [a new project](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md).

The backlog for any particular repository is managed by one or multiple maintainers. The role of the maintainer is to:

1. Maintain the repository, including ensuring the list of issues is up to date and tracking the status of the code.
2. Review and accept proposed changes to the repository they are responsible for.
3. Add new issues for bugs and features for the repository where identified. Contributors are also advised to add new issues for bugs and features if not already available.
4. Assign a priority to each issue using the issue labels: **Priority = High**, **Priority = Medium** and **Priority = Low**.
5. If useful, coordinate with other maintainers during contributor meetings to prioritise issues and projects.
6. Ensure that issues assigned to the contributors are being worked on.

Maintainers should set up the `watch` capacity for projects that they manage to ensure that they are aware of anything that is occurring in the project. It is also recommended that they `star` the relevant repositories of the project while they are working as the maintainer.

If you have experience and want to help, please send an email to [tsc@moja.global](mailto:tsc@moja.global). We are looking for engineers with experience in C++, MRV or carbon flux modelling experience.

## Review or Contribute to a Science Design

All moja global code is informed by a **Science Design**. Science Designs are developed collaboratively and everybody is invited to contribute. It is advisable to review the science design before contributing to the code or the documentation. Follow the following steps to contribute to or review a **Science Design**:

1. Find the **Science Design**:

    - Every moja global repository will have a sub-directory called **Science** in the root directory.
    - The Science folder will contain 2 types of Science Designs:
        - PDF files contain completed science designs.
        - Markdown files contain a link to **Science Design** under development.
    - Locate the PDF file with the highest [version number](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Assign-a-Version.md) for review.
    - Locate the Markdown file with the highest [version number](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Assign-a-Version.md) for a contribution.
    - If no Markdown file is available, proceed with [agreeing on a Science Design](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Agree-on-a-Science-Design.md).

2. Review **Science Design**:

    - Open the PDF file you would wish to review.
    - Changes or suggestions are not possible.
    - If you find an inaccuracy or want to propose an improvement, check whether your change has already been made in the Markdown file with the higher version number.
    - If the change has not been made yet, continue with the contribution to a **Science Design** below.

3. Contribute to a **Science Design**:
    - Open the Markdown file with the highest version number.
    - Follow the URL to the Google Doc with the ongoing science discussion.
    - Contact the Document Owner to join the discussion or just leave a comment in the text.
