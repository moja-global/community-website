Help fight climate change from your keyboard! moja global specialises in software for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use and landuse change. We participate in various mentorship programs which offers a generous stipend and an exceptional working experience to contributors. We also assist new contributors with the software development process, learning how to collaborate with others and how to get the most out of the software development lifecycle.

## Outreachy Internships

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides paid, remote, three-month internships to applicants who identify themselves as women (both cis and trans), trans men, non-binary people, and genderqueer. The aim of this internship is to support diversity in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and uplift the under-represented sections of the society.

The Outreachy internship at moja global for the December 2021 to March 2022 round will be coordinated by [Andrew O'Reilly-Nugent](https://github.com/aornugent).

### Current Project: **Climate change: extend models of forest carbon pools**.

> Puedes leer la descripción del proyecto en español aquí: https://community.moja.global/es/community/mentorship#outreachy-internships/

Land plays an important role in global cycles of greenhouse gases (GHG). Land use activities result in emissions and removals of GHG to the atmosphere. The Fifth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for almost a quarter (~10–12 Gt CO2eq/yr) of anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from activities such as deforestation, forest degradation and also from livestock, soil, nutrient management and agricultural burning.

Moja global's Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) has been developed to support the GHG inventories development and the implementation of mitigation actions in the AFOLU sector. But, some functions and features of the FLINT need to be refined or added in order to fully support mitigation actions and establishment and maintenance of sustainable GHG inventory management systems in developing countries. The UNFCCC secretariat has initiated a collaboration with moja global to refine the FLINT and make it available to developing countries across all regions.

This project focuses on the development of FLINT module to account for the dynamics of carbon from forest living biomass into dead organic matter pools (DOM). A DOM module simulates annual changes in the C stocks of each pool that occur due to growth, biomass turnover, litterfall, transfer and decomposition as well as complex disturbances that can alter biomass turnover, and transfers between DOM pools (litter, dead wood and soil).

The interns are working with moja global ecosystem modelling experts to identify candidate models for describing DOM dynamics in forestry, collect data and parameter calibrations to test and evaluate the DOM module. The interns are working across various domains including writing, project documentation and data management, while expertise in climate change research, data analysis and team collaboration.

The current interns for the project are [David Guevara-Apaza](https://github.com/yodavo), [Simple Shell](https://github.com/Simpleshell3) and [Asmi Jafar](https://github.com/asmijafar20)

## Linux Foundation Mentorship

The [Linux Foundation Mentorship](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/) is designed to help developers with the necessary skills–many of whom are first-time open source contributors–experiment, learn, and contribute effectively to open source communities.

### Current Project: **Cloud native measurement, reporting and validation of carbon emissions**

The Full Lands INtegration Tool (FLINT) is a platform for estimating greenhouse gas emissions at local, national and global scales.

This project aims to build a cloud deployment framework for rapid deployment of FLINT implementations. This framework will be used in a continuous deployment pipeline (CD) for integration testing and the delivery of FLINT as a service (FLINTcloud) for demonstration purposes.

We hope to offer an easy entry point for new users to evaluate the FLINT platform and provide a blueprint for new users to roll their own FLINTcloud deployments. This is critical to help drive the adoption of FLINT and help scale up the monitoring, reporting and validation of carbon emissions and sequestration from land use and land use change around the world.

This involves:

1. Publishing a design for the complete FLINT.Cloud solution, detailing the required components, technologies and endpoints to be exposed.
2. Exposing the core FLINT routines by wrapping the existing command line interface in a REST API.
3. Creating a simple script to install the prerequisite libraries, FLINT and its modules as a standalone microservice.
4. Creating the deployment framework and setting up a CD pipeline on commodity cloud hardware, favouring automation wherever possible (e.g. infrastructure-as-code).
5. Providing new documentation for the cloud deployment procedure.
