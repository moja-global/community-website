            Hello, @${{ github.actor }}!

            I'm a bot that watches for merge conflicts and automatically adds a comment to the PR. Your pull request has merge conflicts with the base branch. You can resolve those conflicts by following the instructions [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)
